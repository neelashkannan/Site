Space-themed background images required:

1. stars.png - A static starfield background image
   This should be a dark/black background with small white dots representing stars.

2. twinkling.png - A semi-transparent overlay with larger stars
   This should be transparent with some larger, brighter stars that will be animated
   to create the twinkling effect.

These images need to be placed in this directory for the space background effect to work.
You can create these as PNG files with transparency as needed.
